# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Build & run

- `cargo build` / `cargo run` — the workspace has two crates: the root binary and `dm-ui`, a build-time-isolation lib crate whose `dm-ui/build.rs` compiles the Slint UI tree (`ui/dark-matter-linux.slint`) with bundled gettext translations from `lang/`, and composes a Twemoji sprite sheet at `$OUT_DIR/twemoji_sprite.png` plus a `$OUT_DIR/emoji_sprite_map.rs` lookup table. The ~345k-line generated Slint module lives inside `dm-ui` (`slint::include_modules!()` in `dm-ui/src/lib.rs`), so editing Rust in `src/` rebuilds only the root crate (~2s); editing `.slint` or `lang/` files rebuilds `dm-ui` too (~25s). The first build is slow because of the marmot dependencies and the sprite composition.
- No test suite exists (`cargo test` is a no-op). Verify changes by running the app.
- Logging: `tracing-subscriber` is installed in `main` (writes to stderr). Filter via `RUST_LOG`; default is `info`.
- Translations: after adding/changing `@tr("…")` strings in `.slint` files, run `scripts/update-translations.sh` (requires `cargo install slint-tr-extractor` and gettext's `msgmerge`) to regenerate `lang/dm-ui.pot` and merge into the `it`/`de`/`ja` catalogs. (The gettext domain is `dm-ui` because slint-build hardwires it to the name of the crate that compiles the UI.)

### marmot crates (git dependency)

`Cargo.toml` pulls `marmot-app`, `marmot-account`, and `cgka-traits` from the private `darkmatter` repo over ssh (`git = "ssh://git@github.com/marmot-protocol/darkmatter.git", branch = "master"`). Anyone with read access to this repo also has read access there. `.cargo/config.toml` sets `net.git-fetch-with-cli` so cargo fetches through the git CLI and your normal ssh keys/agent. `Cargo.lock` pins the exact rev; bump with `cargo update -p marmot-app -p marmot-account -p cgka-traits`.

To develop against a local darkmatter checkout, don't edit `Cargo.toml` — add a patch to `.cargo/config.toml` (or use `[patch]` locally):
```toml
[patch."ssh://git@github.com/marmot-protocol/darkmatter.git"]
marmot-app     = { path = "../darkmatter/crates/marmot-app" }
marmot-account = { path = "../darkmatter/crates/marmot-account" }
cgka-traits    = { path = "../darkmatter/crates/traits" }
```
Note: changes in darkmatter must be **pushed to master** before they're visible to a plain build here.

`whitenoise-markdown` (chat-body markdown parser) is a separate git dependency on the public `whitenoise-rs` repo.

### Runtime env vars

- `DM_HOME` — override data dir (default: `directories::ProjectDirs` for `"darkmatter"`). Holds the encrypted vault (`vault.db`), the encrypted media cache (`media-cache/`), and an optional `observability.toml` override.
- `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` / `DISPLAY` — clipboard chooses `wl-copy` on Wayland and falls back to `xclip` / `xsel` / `arboard` on X11 (Linux and FreeBSD). If neither var is set, only the `arboard` fallback runs. On macOS these vars are ignored: the clipboard goes through `pbcopy`, with `arboard` as fallback.

(`DM_SECRET_STORE` is gone — there is no more libsecret/pass/plaintext path. See the secret vault below.)

## Architecture

### Layering

```
slint UI (ui/*.slint)  ←──  dm-ui (generated Slint module)  ←──  src/main.rs (~7k lines of glue)  ──→  Backend (src/backend.rs)  ──→  MarmotApp (sibling crate) + tokio runtime
```

- The `dm-ui` crate owns `slint::include_modules!()` and re-exports all generated Slint types; `main.rs` pulls them in with `use dm_ui::*;`. UI structs (`ChatMessage`, `ChatMeta`, `GroupMember`, `Contact`, `ArchivedChat`, `Reaction`) live in `ui/tokens.slint`; Rust constructs them directly. The split exists purely so Rust edits don't recompile the generated module — don't put app logic in `dm-ui`.
- `src/main.rs` owns the entire callback wiring. It's flat by design: there are no submodules for "send", "react", "members"; everything lives in `main.rs` so the data flow for a given UI action is readable top-to-bottom.
- `Backend` (`src/backend.rs`, ~1.8k lines) wraps `MarmotApp` plus its own multi-thread tokio runtime. It exposes `tokio_handle()` so callers can `spawn` ad-hoc background work (HTTP fetches, etc.) on that same runtime instead of standing up a second one. All platform-specific code (clipboard, paths) lives here.
- Support modules are thin and single-purpose: `vault.rs` (password-encrypted secret vault), `settings.rs` (JSON UI prefs), `blossom.rs` (public Blossom uploads), `media_cache.rs` (encrypted attachment cache), `observability.rs` (telemetry/audit endpoint config). They do not own state — the UI does.

### Secret vault

There is no OS keyring, no `pass`, and no plaintext key on disk. All secrets — the user's nsec plus marmot's per-account keys — live in one password-encrypted file, `$DM_HOME/vault.db` (`vault.rs`):

- **Format:** a serde envelope `{ version, kdf{argon2id salt + cost params}, nonce, ciphertext }`. The ciphertext is `XChaCha20-Poly1305(serde_json(BTreeMap<String,String>))` keyed by `Argon2id(password, salt)`. Every mutation re-seals the whole map under a fresh nonce and atomically renames into place (mode `0600`). The derived key is held in `Zeroizing` and wiped on drop.
- **Unlock vs create:** on startup, if `vault.db` exists the login screen opens in mode 3 (Unlock — enter password). Otherwise it's first-run: the user pastes/generates an nsec **and** sets a password (with confirm), which creates the vault. A wrong password fails the Poly1305 tag → `VaultError::WrongPassword`. There is no recovery; the unlock screen offers "Use another key" which deletes the vault and restarts from the nsec.
- **marmot integration:** `VaultSecretStore` implements marmot's `AccountSecretStore` and is passed to `AccountHome::open_with_secret_store` in `Backend::boot`. So marmot's account secrets land in the *same* vault file (under `account:<label>` keys) instead of libsecret/plaintext. The same `Arc<Mutex<Vault>>` unlocked on the login screen is threaded into boot.
- **Blob sealing:** `Vault::seal_blob` / `open_blob` encrypt arbitrary byte blobs under a vault subkey — used by the media cache so nothing decrypted ever hits disk in plaintext.

### Media: two upload paths + encrypted cache

- **Chat attachments** go through marmot's encrypted MIP-04 path (sealed blobs only group members can read; content type is always `application/octet-stream`). The UI resolves a record's NIP-92 `imeta` tag to download/decrypt on tap.
- **Profile pictures** are the opposite — publicly fetchable — so `blossom.rs` is a deliberately simple unencrypted path: BUD-01/BUD-02 `PUT /upload` with a signed kind-24242 auth event, returning the public URL that goes into the kind-0 `picture` field. Default server: `https://blossom.primal.net`.
- **`media_cache.rs`** is an encrypted-at-rest disk cache for *decrypted* attachment bytes at `$DM_HOME/media-cache/<blob_hash>.bin`, sealed with the vault's media-cache subkey, content-addressed by the Blossom blob hash. Best-effort: any IO/crypto failure degrades to a miss → fresh download+decrypt. Cleared entirely on vault reset (old-key entries are unreadable anyway). It stores original compressed bytes (PNG/JPEG), not decoded RGBA.

### Observability (telemetry + audit logs)

`observability.toml` at the repo root holds OTLP-metrics and Goggles-audit endpoints/tokens (deliberately not secret). It's embedded into the binary at build time (`include_str!`); a copy at `$DM_HOME/observability.toml` overrides it at runtime without a rebuild. `Backend::configure_observability` feeds these to marmot's relay-telemetry exporter and audit-log tracker at boot — but **sending only happens when the user enables the Telemetry / Audit-logs toggles in Settings → Advanced**. Those enabled-flags live in marmot's settings store (not `settings.rs`), via `telemetry_enabled()` / `audit_logs_enabled()` and their setters; the audit toggle takes effect on next restart.

### Settings (`settings.rs`)

UI prefs as a tiny JSON blob in XDG config: `debug_enabled`, `locale` (`en`/`it`/`de`/`ja`), `theme` (`dark`/`light`/`retro`), `accent_color` (`mint`/`ocean`/`berry`/`coral`/`lavender`), `outgoing_on_right`, and `nicknames` (private per-contact nicknames keyed by account hex — local-only, never published to relays). All load/save failures are swallowed; defaults keep the app booting.

### Optimistic overlay model

All UI mutations (send, react, unreact) go through a `PendingState` overlay in `main.rs`:

1. Mutation applied locally to the overlay; UI rebuilds the affected message rows from `backend snapshot ∪ overlay`.
2. Real op dispatched on the tokio runtime.
3. On ack: drop the overlay entry; the next rebuild now pulls the confirmed record from the snapshot.
4. On failure: mark the overlay entry failed (red bubble, tap to retry).

Three entry points share the same model→row pipeline; **changing the avatar/text/etc. for a row means touching all three**:
- `chat_message_from_with_reactions(record, records_by_id, my_id, my_label, reactions)` — confirmed rows (`records_by_id` is a prebuilt message-id → record map for reply-preview lookups).
- `pending_chat_message(pending, my_id, my_label)` — pending/failed rows.
- `build_one_message_row(...)` / `rebuild_chat_messages(...)` / `refresh_one_message_row(...)` — orchestrators that call the two above.

`my_label` is the user's display name (`backend.account_display_name(&my_id)`, falling back to the account hex). It drives the outgoing-bubble avatar palette/initials so the user's own messages look consistent with the left-rail avatar.

### Markdown rendering

Chat bodies are parsed with `whitenoise-markdown` (the same CommonMark + GFM + nostr-entity parser whitenoise-rs uses) into a `Document`, then flattened in `main.rs` into the bubble's line/run model: each `MessageLine` is one visual line, each `MessageRun` an inline text/emoji cell with resolved styling; block context (heading scale, list/blockquote indent, code plates, rules) rides on the line. Line wrapping is Rust-side and greedy — character widths are *estimated* (`MD_CHAR_W`, `MD_EMOJI_W` fractions of font-size) only to decide break points; Slint draws with real metrics.

### Avatar pipeline

Two layers:

1. **Deterministic fallback** — `avatar_for(key: &str) -> (Color, Color, String)` hashes any string into a gradient + initials. Used for everyone (self, peers, group rows). Always renders something.
2. **Profile pictures** — `fetch_profile_picture` / `fetch_picture_pixels` GET the URL via `reqwest`, decode with `image`, and cache as raw RGBA (`PicturePixels { w, h, rgba }`) in a process-wide `OnceLock<Mutex<HashMap<...>>>`.

**Critical constraint:** `slint::Image` contains a `VRc<...>` that is `!Send`. You cannot move an `Image` across `tokio::spawn` → `slint::invoke_from_event_loop`. The cache stores `PicturePixels` (which is `Send`); the `slint::Image` is reconstructed on the UI thread via `slint::SharedPixelBuffer::clone_from_slice` + `Image::from_rgba8` inside the event-loop closure.

`Avatar` (`ui/primitives/avatar.slint`) takes `picture: image` + `has-picture: bool`. When `has-picture` is false it renders initials over the gradient; when true it renders the `Image` with `image-fit: cover` and `clip: true` (the circular border-radius does the clip).

### Build-time sprite sheet

`dm-ui/build.rs` walks all `emojis::iter()`, looks up each in `twemoji-assets`, and composes a single 44-column 72px-tile sheet. Runtime renders the picker with one shared texture and per-cell `source-clip` — never decoding individual PNGs at runtime. The emitted `EMOJI_POSITIONS` table and the sprite PNG bytes are included in `dm-ui/src/lib.rs` (`emoji_sprite_map` module, `EMOJI_SPRITE_PNG`) and re-exported to `main.rs`.

### i18n

All user-visible Slint strings use `@tr("…")`. `dm-ui/build.rs` bundles the gettext catalogs from `lang/` (`slint_build::CompilerConfiguration::new().with_bundled_translations("../lang")`); locales are `en` (source), `it`, `de`, `ja`. Runtime switching happens via `slint::select_bundled_translation` (`apply_locale` in `main.rs`), driven by `Settings.locale` and the language-picker modal. Catalog maintenance is `scripts/update-translations.sh` (see Build & run).

### Slint conventions specific to this repo

- **Three-way theme** (`Theme` global in `ui/tokens.slint`): `Theme.retro` flips the entire UI to a SNES-era palette + the `Zpix` pixel font with pixel-sharp corners (`r-scale: 0`, chunky 2px borders); `Theme.light` switches the modern UI to a warm light palette. Every color token branches `Theme.retro ? … : (Theme.light ? … : …)`. When adding a new component, provide all three modes — never hard-code colors that the retro/light/modern split would otherwise change.
- **Accent system:** `Theme.accent` is an index (0..4 = mint/ocean/berry/coral/lavender) into per-theme lookup tables (`accent-base` / `accent-hi` / `accent-dim`). Read accent colors from `Theme`, never hardcode mint.
- Font sizes are written as `font-size: 12px * Theme.fs-scale` — never a bare `font-size: 12px`. (`fs-scale` is currently 1.0 in all modes, but the multiplier is the established pattern and may change with fonts.)
- Border radius is scaled by `Theme.r-scale` so retro mode can zero it.
- The left-rail / outgoing-bubble / profile-page / members-list avatars all read from a common `my-av-*` set of root properties on `DarkMatterLinux`, pushed from Rust on profile load. Don't reintroduce hardcoded initials/colors at the leaf — wire the property through.

## Learned User Preferences

- Avoid adding Python project tooling or helper scripts; prefer Rust or the existing shell/toolchain workflows.
- For i18n work, keep scope to Slint `@tr()` bundled catalogs unless explicitly asked; do not propose Rust-side string translation.
- When implementing from an attached plan, do not edit the plan file itself; update the already-created todos instead of recreating them.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- `Cargo.toml` sets `default-run = "darkmatter-linux"`; use `cargo run --bin bootbench` for the benchmark binary.
- Slint i18n is bundled from `lang/` via `dm-ui/build.rs`; maintain catalogs with `scripts/update-translations.sh` and edit `.po` files directly.
- `dm-ui/build.rs` reuses `twemoji_sprite.png` and `emoji_sprite_map.rs` from `OUT_DIR` when both exist, so sprite generation should only run when an output is missing.
- Encrypted media downloads retry Marmot redirect failures by resolving Blossom redirects in `src/backend.rs` while validating each hop before retrying.
- Group chats expose a member-list panel backed by `Backend::group_members`, `GroupMember` Slint rows, and `push_group_members_to_ui`.
