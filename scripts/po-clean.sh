# Used in two places, so the rules live here once:
#   * the git `po-clean` clean filter (.gitattributes -> registered by
#     scripts/install-hooks.sh), which runs on every `git add`;
#   * the .githooks/pre-commit hook, which also rewrites the working tree.

# It MUST be idempotent — running it twice must yield byte-identical output —
# or it would itself create the phantom diffs it exists to prevent.
#
#   --no-location   drop "#: file:line" refs so UI source-line shifts never
#                   surface as catalog diffs
#   --sort-output   stable order keyed on msgid. NOT --sort-by-file: once
#                   --no-location strips the file refs, sort-by-file has no key
#                   left and the order flips on the next pass (not idempotent).
#   --no-wrap       one string per line; no width-dependent rewrapping
#   --no-obsolete   drop `#~` obsolete entries. When a @tr string moves to a
#                   different Slint component its msgctxt changes, so msgmerge
#                   retires the old context as obsolete; left in, these dead
#                   entries pile up on every refactor. Stripping them here keeps
#                   the catalogs to their live strings.
