# soak.rb — long-running endurance / churn scenario (default 10 min).
#
# Everyone in one group; then, concurrently and at RANDOM intervals:
#   • every VM sends messages,
#   • the admin (vm1) renames the group,
#   • every non-admin VM disconnects and later reconnects (daemon stop/start —
#     a real client offline→online cycle, which resyncs from the relays on
#     reconnect).
# vm1 stays online so renames keep flowing. After the duration elapses we bring
# everyone back online, let delivery settle, and verify every VM received every
# message that was actually sent (order irrelevant). The expected set is the
# ground truth of what each VM *successfully* sent while online — so this proves
# offline VMs catch up across both missed messages AND missed epoch/rename
# commits.
#
# Usage:  ruby scripts/scenarios/soak.rb [N]   (default 5; min 2)
# Env:    DM_SOAK_SECS — run duration in seconds (default 600)
