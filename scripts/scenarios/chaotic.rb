# Everyone in one group, then ALL VMs blast messages AT THE SAME TIME. Ordering
# is irrelevant — this only confirms that every VM eventually received every
# message, and exits non-zero if any VM is missing any.

# Usage:  ruby scripts/scenarios/chaotic.rb [N]   (default 5; min 2)
# Env:    DM_CHAOS_MSGS — messages each VM fires (default 3; total = N × this)

# Every joined VM fires CHAOS_MSGS messages at once. One thread per VM (the sends
# are blocking subprocess calls, so Ruby threads give real overlap), each thread
# firing back-to-back. No ordering, no turn-taking — maximum interleave.
