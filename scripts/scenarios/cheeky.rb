# cheeky.rb — "cheeky admins" convergence scenario (default 10 min).
#
# Everyone in one group, and EVERYONE is made an admin. Then for the duration,
# every VM independently and at RANDOM intervals does a random cheeky thing:
#   • send a message,
#   • rename the group,
#   • promote a random other member to admin,
#   • demote a random other member.
#
# Renames/promotes/demotes are MLS commits, and MLS allows only one commit per
# epoch — so concurrent admins constantly race, one wins and the rest are
# rejected and must catch up. The whole point of the test is the AFTERMATH:
# once the chaos stops and things settle, do all VMs converge on a single agreed
# state? We check that every VM agrees on:
#   • the group name,
#   • the admin set,
#   • the member set,
# and that every VM received every message that was sent (order irrelevant).
#
# (Admin role IS observable: group-list carries admin_policy.admins; group name
# is profile.name. There's no global oracle for "the correct" final state —
# it's whatever the MLS DAG converged to — so we assert all VMs are IDENTICAL,
# which is exactly "we can agree on a state".)
#
# Usage:  ruby scripts/scenarios/cheeky.rb [N]   (default 5; min 3 to be cheeky)
# Env:    DM_CHEEKY_SECS — run duration in seconds (default 600)
